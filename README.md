# ✨ Gemini clone Chat bot on React📱

### Live demo 👉 - [click](https://m-anttt.github.io/gemini_clone/)

The chat bot works with Gemini API by Google to access generative models. The app can receive text (Gemini 1.5 Pro) and image + text prompts (Gemini Pro Vision). Also, recent prompts are displayed on the sidebar and can be accessed. As part of the work with the stylization of the model's response, I tried to avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML and chose another way to separate information and add jsx tags.

* 🌍 For many countries using API may require VPN connection, otherwise sending/receiving prompts won't work
* I was not trying to identically copy the Gemini layout and styles, so changed some details a bit (e.g., image input)
